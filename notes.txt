two main types of instruction

A instructions

C instructions

dest = comp;jump 
dest is optional
jump is optional

also keep track of:
- comments



at the end we go over it twice looking for
labels?

make a dictionary w the labels and locations or smth

{'R0': 0, etc} or smth like that

What to do:
1. convert comp, dest, jump to binary (DONE)
2. get computer to not just convert to binary (can't be that bad right haha)
3. keep track of lines but ignore comments (continue loop or smth)
4. remember how A instructions work
5. look at zfill
